### Main weather page
This page is the first page of our app. There are several buttons that make us access different other pages in the website. First we have the "Current Weather" button that will direct to the page where we can check current weather details for any city we want. Then, there is the "Weather Forecast" button that directs us to the page where we can see forecasts for any city we want. Then as written, to have the possibility to add cities as favorite, the user needs either to Login or Register. These 2 buttons direct us to forms we need to fill.

### Current weather page
This page has a search bar where we can type in any city we want. When we click on the get weather button, we can see a lot of different weather details about the city like the temperature, the wind, the clouds coverage, etc. We can search as much as we want.

### Forecast page
This page gives weather forecasts for a specific cities with Highcharts. The user can select up to 3 cities for which the weather will be predicted. Then, the user has access to 2 charts, the first one being the forecast for the next 24 hours and the second one being the forecast for the next 5 days

</div>


### Favorite page
This page lists all of the cities that were saved as favorite by the user so they can have a quick acces to them. We used AG-Grid to do that and the user can sort their favorite cities by name, temperature, wind, etc. They can also remove any city they want from the list.

### User page
When a user is logged in, they have access to this page where they can add favorite cities and preview some weather details. Then they can access their favorite list and view the forecasts. if they click on any of the cities, it directs them to the current weather page.

## Backend Description
First, we used MySQL to create and store our users and their favorite cities. The backend is connected to this Database and thus compiling the website might work for any other person than us. To use the database from MySQL, we need to give a username and a password as well as the host IP address and the name of our database.
We created some CRUD requests to retrieve the data from MySQL and also modify it. This way we can add users to the database.

For the weather part, we used to APIs: openweathermap and openmeteo. We use their key and extract data from thos APIs with GET requests.

Finally, we used Swagger UI to view and test our CRUD routes with the /api-docs http address. We also used Postman for some time.
